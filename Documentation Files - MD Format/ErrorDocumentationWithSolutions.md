| 1/20/2024 - Adam | Using 18.04.4 ubuntu doesnt work on new laptops. (Lenovo Thinkpad E16 gen 1) is one of the laptops that did not work. | Using ubuntu on a virtual machine will work for getting to know this operating system but will have restrictions for actually setting up the build enviorment and was deamed unwise to use this for the actual build as there is alot of external components to this project. |
| 2/6/2024 - Cole | Login screen loop after first reboot once Ubuntu is installed | Switching to 18.04.5 resolved this issue. (18.04.6 should also be viable if 18.04.4/5 does not work) |
| 2/13/2024 - Cole | Character encoding is broken in TeraTerm output when interfacing with the BytePipe via serial connection | First, when opening Tera Term, I chose the Serial option instead of TCP/IP Then I chose the serial port the BytePipe was on, which was COM4 for me Next I had to go to Setup > Serial and change the speed to 115200. Once that was done I clicked the "New Setting" button to confirm the change Then I went to Setup > General and changed the language from UTF-8 to English After that I had to physically reset the BytePipe to get the output for the startup process in the terminal (had to do this multiple times sometimes) |
| 2/27/2024 -<br>Adam | Installing dependencies for build enviorment with school WIFI will fail to download multiple dependencies | Since the school WIFI blocks certain websites we assumed that was why it couldnt fully download but it allowed us to download all dependencies on our personal WIFI at our homes. Hotspot on a phone may also work but could take longer and this method is untested. |

| 3/7/2024 - Ahmed | Kernel not booting up after being copied to SD card | Copied image was image.ub replace with just image and make sure boot.scr, BOOT.bin and rootfs.cpio.uboot.gz are all included within your SD card |
| 3/20/2024 -Cole | Vivado Licensing Issue | To get the Vivado Enterprise ML edition license, open Vivado and go to Help > Manage License. Once the license manager is open, go to the "Obtain License" page, select the fourth option ("Get My Full or Purchased Certificate-Based License") and select the "Connect Now" button. From there you have to sign into your AMD account and from there you'll be able to manage your licenses. At the very least you have to get the Vivado ML Enterprise Edition license. Something good to know about this license is that it needs to be renewed every 30 days. Once you've claimed your license you need to check your email for the confirmation email that's sent directly after requesting the license. Once you get to the page where you're viewing your license, you have to click a little blue down arrow icon that downloads a xilinx.lic file to your system. This file then needs to be loaded within the Vivado license manager program. |
| 3/29/2024-Ahmed | No rule to make devicetree.dtb | You need to set up the cross environment variables first (ARCH=arm64 and CROSS\_COMPILER=path to your linear compiler) and then at the top directory of your linux-adi kernel run make xilinx/devicetree.dtb |
